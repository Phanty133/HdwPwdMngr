# Hardware password manager

Main idea: A physical password manager that auto-injects temporary .exe binary as an interface to the password manager device.

Hardware:
	- Some small Arduino or ATTiny
	- SPI Flash Memory Winbond?
	- Button

Software:
	- Binary uploader (Uploads .exe binary to flash memory)
	- Password manager back-end
	- Password manager interface

Usage:
	1. Plug the device into a USB slot
	2. Press button on device
		2.1. If it is the first time running the device, inject the interface .exe into a temporary directory
		2.2. Run interface .exe, which opens a terminal menu
	3. Select account (A popup opens that shows which account has been selected)
	4. Go to login input
	5. Press button once: Username is copied into clipboard
	6. Paste username
	7. Press button again: Password is copied into clipboard
	8. Paste password
	9. Login
	10. Press button again: deselect account or close interface (Configurable)

Interface:
	- Move around with arrow keys, go to previous menu with Esc, select with Enter (Select menus and stuff with function keys?)
	- Main menu: a scrollable list of all stored accounts indexed by user-given label

	Add an entry: 
		1. Select `Add account` in the password manager
		2. A new menu opens with inputs `Label`, `Username`, `Password` and buttons `Ok`, `Cancel`
	Remove an entry:
		1. Select account
		2. Select `Delete` option

Ideas:
	- Some installable tool that runs in the background that auto-backups and encrypts data stored in the password manager device
		- Only for authorized devices (Requires some sort of key? SSH?)
	- On-device encryption?
	- Interface includes some sort of authentication that only lets it communicate with the device (SSH?)

FYI:
	- Press = Hold for ~250ms?

Navbar:
